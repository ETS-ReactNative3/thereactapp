[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) is used to render sample posts on HomeTab. For fetch data from firebase, you have to add your firebase keys in `FirebaseConfig.js` file

```
var FirebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: BuildConfig.FIREBASE_API_KEY,
    authDomain: BuildConfig.FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
    databaseURL: BuildConfig.FIREBASE_DB_URL,
    projectId: BuildConfig.FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
    storageBucket: BuildConfig.FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
};
```

Get all your firebase keys and add here at `src/config/FirebaseConfig.js`. And that's all!!!
